name: web-scraping
description: Use for known URLs/content to scrape/read, summarize, map robots/sitemaps/llms, crawl links, batch URLs, diff snapshots, extract JSON/regex/verticals/selector, get responseId/jobId, not search/research
---

## How to choose

1. **URL from a known site?** → use `web_extract` with the matching vertical action (table below). Hits APIs directly — no HTML scraping. (GitHub, npm, Reddit, PyPI, arXiv, etc.)
2. **Need the raw page content?** → `web_scrape`. Read a single URL. Add `mode=fingerprint` if bot-protected.
3. **Need structured data from a page?** → `web_extract` with pattern (sections/regex/excerpts), selector (CSS/XPath), or adhoc (LLM).
4. **Need to explore a site?** → `web_crawl` to follow links and read pages. Or `web_map` for URL inventory only.
5. **Multiple independent URLs?** → `web_batch` for parallel scraping.
6. **Compare page changes?** → `web_diff` against stored snapshots.
7. **Get a previous result back?** → `web_get_result` by responseId, jobId, or snapshot.

## Tools

Each tool has a reference with full args, examples, and rules.

| `web_summarize` | Summarize via LLM (single source) | [ref](references/tools/web_summarize.md) |
| `web_map` | Inventory URLs from robots/sitemaps/llms (no bodies) | [ref](references/tools/web_map.md) |
| `web_crawl` | Follow links, read pages, build context | [ref](references/tools/web_crawl.md) |
| `web_batch` | Scrape many independent URLs in parallel | [ref](references/tools/web_batch.md) |
| `web_diff` | Diff current content against stored snapshot | [ref](references/tools/web_diff.md) |

| `web_get_result` | Retrieve stored result by responseId/jobId/snapshot | [ref](references/tools/web_get_result.md) |

## Vertical extractors

Use `web_extract action=<name> url=<url>` — bypasses HTML scraping via site APIs.

## Modes

Set `mode=<name>` on scrape/crawl tools when fast isn't enough.

| If this happens → | Use mode | Ref |

| Let it escalate automatically | `auto` | [ref](references/modes/auto.md) |
